# Task Management System

## Overview  
This project is a task management system that allows users to track and manage their tasks effectively. Users can complete tasks, generate reports, remove tasks, view tasks, and receive task suggestions, all while visualizing task completion data through a stacked bar chart, grouped by date and categorized by priority levels (high, medium, low).

## Features  
- **Task Completion:** Users can mark tasks as complete, preserving them for future reference instead of deleting them from the system.  
- **Remove Tasks:** Users can remove tasks from the system entirely if they are no longer needed.  
- **Priority-Based Visualization:** Completed tasks are displayed in a stacked bar chart, grouped by date and divided into priority levels (high, medium, low).  
- **Daily Report:** At the end of each day, users can generate a report summarizing the tasks they completed, categorized by priority and completion date.  
- **View Tasks:** Users can visualize all their tasks in a user-friendly interface, making it easy to track and manage them.  
- **Task Suggestions:** Based on the tasks in the system, users can receive recommendations for which tasks they should focus on next.

## How It Works  
- **Adding Tasks:** Users can add tasks with a description, deadline, and priority (high, medium, or low).  
- **Completing Tasks:** Once a task is finished, users can mark it as completed. The task will be saved for reporting.  
- **Removing Tasks:** Users can remove tasks from the system if they are no longer needed, ensuring the task list remains relevant.  
- **Generating Reports:** Users can generate a stacked bar chart showing the total tasks completed each day, segmented by priority levels, to visualize their productivity trends.  
- **View Tasks:** Users can visualize all the tasks in a user-friendly way, making it simple to track and manage the task list.  
- **Task Suggestions:** The system provides suggestions for which tasks the user should prioritize based on their current task list and deadlines.
