# Task Management System

## Overview  
This project is a task management system that allows users to track and manage their tasks effectively. Users can complete tasks, generate reports, and visualize task completion data through a stacked bar chart, grouped by date and categorized by priority levels (high, medium, low).

## Features  
- **Task Completion:** Users can mark tasks as complete, preserving them for future reference instead of deleting them from the system.  
- **Priority-Based Visualization:** Completed tasks are displayed in a stacked bar chart, grouped by date and divided into priority levels (high, medium, low).  
- **Daily Report:** At the end of each day, users can generate a report summarizing the tasks they completed, categorized by priority and completion date.

## How It Works  
- **Adding Tasks:** Users can add tasks with a description, deadline, and priority (high, medium, or low).  
- **Completing Tasks:** Once a task is finished, users can mark it as completed. The task will be saved for reporting.  
- **Generating Reports:** Users can generate a stacked bar chart showing the total tasks completed each day, segmented by priority levels, to visualize their productivity trends.  
- **View Tasks:** Users can visualize all the tasks in a user-friendly way.  
- **Task Suggestions:** Users can get a list of suggestions for which tasks they should focus on right now.
